Maze Generation and Agent-Solving

This project demonstrates how to generate a random maze, visualize an agent solving it using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, and simulate a learning rate based on exploration steps. The agent explores the maze step-by-step until it finds the shortest path, and the solution path and simulated learning rate over time are plotted for better visualization.
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Maze Generation: Generates a random maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.</li>
  <li>BFS Maze Solver: An agent solves the maze using BFS, finding the shortest path from the start to the end point.</li>
  <li>Visualization:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A plot showing the maze, the solution path, and the start and end points.</li>
      <li> A graph that simulates the agent's "learning rate" over time (steps) during exploration.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
Make sure you have the following installed:
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>matplotlib for visualizing the maze and learning rate.</li>
  <li>numpy for handling the maze data structure.</li>
</ul>
